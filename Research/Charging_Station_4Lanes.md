Converting a bank with drive-thru lanes into an electric vehicle (EV) charging station is an interesting idea, especially given the increasing adoption of electric vehicles. However, there are several factors to consider before making such a conversion, including the electrical infrastructure, cost, regulations, and business model viability.
 
### Electrical Infrastructure
 
The 200A service to the building may not be sufficient for multiple rapid chargers, which typically require a lot of power. For example, a single Level 3 DC fast charger can require anywhere from 50 kW to 350 kW, which translates to roughly 200A to over 1000A at 480V for the higher end of power delivery. To power multiple chargers, you'd likely need to upgrade your electrical service significantly.
 
The 100A subpanel for the drive-thru lanes is also likely insufficient for rapid charging. Each rapid charger could require its own dedicated 100A circuit at a high voltage, depending on the charger specifications.
 
### Cost and Materials
 
The cost of installing EV charging stations can vary widely based on several factors:
 
1. **Charger Type**: Level 2 chargers are less expensive but slower, while Level 3 DC fast chargers are much more expensive but provide rapid charging.
2. **Electrical Upgrades**: Upgrading your electrical service to accommodate the high power demand of rapid chargers can be costly.
3. **Construction**: Costs for trenching, conduit, wiring, and installation labor.
4. **Permitting and Compliance**: Costs for permits, inspections, and any required compliance with ADA or local regulations.
5. **Networking**: Some charging stations require network connectivity for user access and payment processing.
 
For a rough estimate, installing a single Level 3 charger can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000 or more, including the charger and installation. Multiplying this by four for each drive-thru lane, and adding the cost of electrical service upgrades, you could be looking at several hundred thousand dollars.
 
### Strategy
 
1. **Feasibility Study**: Conduct a study to assess the demand for EV charging in your area, competition, and potential pricing models.
2. **Electrical Assessment**: Hire a professional electrician or an electrical engineer to assess the current electrical infrastructure and determine the feasibility and cost of necessary upgrades.
3. **Permits and Regulations**: Check with your local municipality for any permits or regulations regarding the installation of EV charging stations.
4. **Business Model**: Consider how you will charge for the service (e.g., per kWh, per hour, membership model) and what additional amenities or services you could offer to differentiate your charging station.
 
### Business Model Viability
 
The viability of this business model depends on several factors:
 
- **Location**: Is the bank located in an area with a high density of EVs or along a route frequented by EV drivers?
- **Demand**: Is there existing or projected demand for rapid charging stations?
- **Competition**: Are there other charging stations nearby, and what do they offer?
- **Pricing**: Can you price the service competitively while still covering your costs and making a profit?
- **Incentives**: Are there government incentives for installing EV charging stations that could offset some of the costs?
 
Before proceeding, you should conduct thorough market research and possibly consult with a business advisor who specializes in the EV charging industry. It's also important to consider future trends in EV adoption and charging technology, as the landscape is rapidly evolving.
 
In summary, while converting a bank drive-thru into an EV charging station could be a forward-thinking business venture, it requires careful planning, significant investment, and a clear understanding of the market and regulatory environment.

PROMPT:

i have a small bank with 800 sq ft indoors.

Then, 4 drive-thru lanes.

I'm considering converting it to an electric charging station.
 
I currently have 200A service to the building.
 
Then, there is a 100A subpanel right beside the main breaker that goes out to the drive thru lane, about 100 ft away on the other side of the building.
 
All the wires route through the ceiling, which has easy drop-down panels.
 
How much would it cost and what materials / strategy would be needed to add car charging ports for rapid charging out in each drive-thru lane.
 
Do you suggest this as a business model?
